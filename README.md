This repository contains 2 directories: ExampleModels/ which shows examples of how to create, train, and save new track quality classifiers, and DefaultModel/ which holds the code that recreates the current default L1TK track quality model used in CMSSW. Instructions for how to use each directory are in the respective README.md files within each folder.
